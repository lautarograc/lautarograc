I’m Lautaro Graciani
I'm a 19yo male from Rosario, Argentina
I study economics at the Universidad Nacional de Rosario (National University of Rosario)
I'm interested mostly in data science and AI, but I also like webdev (frontend especially) and, as a hobby, bussiness oriented programming (cobol)
I’m currently learning python, machine learning and fundamentals
I’m looking to collaborate on neural networks

I'm always open to receive messages at my linkedin (https://www.linkedin.com/in/lautaro-graciani/) and at my mailbox (lautarograciani2106@gmail.com)
