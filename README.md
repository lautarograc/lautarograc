# Hey! Welcome to my humble profile.

[![My GitHub Journey](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=lautarograc)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)

**I'm Lautaro Graciani, a computer science student with a rising expertise on web development.**

*I love to be a driver of value. I enjoy designing, coding and developing things that will bring tangible valuable to society. On the other hand, I hate losing my time in reinventing the wheel. I try to focus more on the "what" than in the "how". And building something new is almost always the answer to the "what".*

As part of my stack, I heavily prefer working with Ruby on Rails. I usually find the coupling of a Rails API with a SPA framework (especially with React) to deliver a great and probably unmatched development experience, but I'm following the development of [hotwire](https://hotwired.dev/) with great interest.

I also love TypeScript. And even if I heavily used Python in my previous projects, I just don't see myself choosing it over Ruby or TS for anything.

*Another niche interest I have is the [crystal-lang](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal) project. I'm using it more and more to develop isolated, side services and I can't wait to see how much the community will end up growing in the next few yeras.*

<br/> Part of my hobbies include music ([my musical taste constantly changes](https://stats.fm/lautarograciani)), football and videogames.
