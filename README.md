#### **Important**  
  
Someone has been impersonating me, using parts of my real resume and giving out my real GitHub and portfolio in real work interviews. Please, take attention if you received a communication from someone claiming to be "Lautaro Graciani" from a source that is not my personal linkedin (https://linkedin.com/in/lautaro-graciani), my personal GitHub (this one) or one of my personal emails ([lautaro@graciani.ar](mailto:lautaro@graciani.ar) for formal communications, I may also use either [lautarograciani14@gmail.com](mailto:lautarograciani14@gmail.com) or [lautarograciani2106@gmail.com](mailto:lautarograciani2106@gmail.com) ).
